This Project demonstrates AES encryption/decryption in a Duplex and P2P configuration using the LoRa protocol.\
Dependency: https://github.com/josephpal/esp32-Encrypt we will need this repository added as a library to the Arduino IDE.\
Prerequisites: 2 LoRa32 boards: 2 ESP32 boards with an attached antenna, LoRa module and oled display each.\
There are 2 ways to see the i/o:\
